             <p>Energy Stored in a Capacitor
Once the opposite charges have been placed on either side of a parallel-plate capacitor, the charges can be used to work by allowing them to move towards each other through a circuit. The equation gives the total energy that can be extracted from a fully charged capacitor:

 
 
Capacitors function a lot like rechargeable batteries. The main difference between a capacitor and a battery lies in the technique they employ to store energy. Unlike batteries, the capacitor’s ability to store energy doesn’t come from chemical reactions but from the physical design that allows it to hold negative and positive charges apart.

Standard Units of Capacitance
The basic unit of capacitance is Farad. But, Farad is a large unit for practical tasks. Hence, capacitance is usually measured in the sub-units of Farads, such as micro-farads (µF) or pico-farads (pF).

Most of the electrical and electronic applications are covered by the following standard unit (SI) prefixes for easy calculations:

1 mF (millifarad) = 10−3 F
1 μF (microfarad) =10−6 F
1 nF (nanofarad) = 10−9 F
1 pF (picofarad) = 10−12 F
The parallel plate capacitor as shown in the figure has two identical conducting plates, each having a surface area A and separated by a distance d. When voltage V is applied to the plates, it stores charge Q.

The force between charges increases with charge values and decreases with the distance between them. The bigger the area of the plates, the more charge they can store.  Hence, the value of C is greater for a large value of A. Similarly, the closer the plates are, the greater the attraction of the opposite charges on them. Therefore C is greater for a smaller d.

The formula gives the charge density on the plates

 
 
When the distance of separation (d) is small, the electric field between the plates is fairly uniform, and its magnitude is given by:

 
 
As the electric field between the plates is uniform, the potential difference between the plates is given by

 
 
 
Substituting the above value of V in the capacitance formula, we get

Capacitance of a Sphere
Since the late 18th century, capacitors have been used to store electrical energy. Individual capacitors do not hold much energy, providing only enough power for electronic devices during temporary power outages or when they need additional power. Many applications use capacitors as energy sources, and a few of them are as follows:

Audio equipment
Camera Flashes
Power supplies
Magnetic coils
Lasers
Supercapacitors are capacitors that have high capacitances up to 2 kF. These capacitors store large amounts of energy and offer new technological possibilities in areas such as electric cars, regenerative braking in the automotive industry and industrial electrical motors, computer memory backup during power loss, and many others.

Capacitors for Power Conditioning
One of the important applications of capacitors is the conditioning of power supplies. Capacitors allow only AC signals to pass when they are charged, blocking DC signals. This capacitor effect is used in separating or decoupling different parts of electrical circuits to reduce noise as a result of improving efficiency. Capacitors are also used in utility substations to counteract inductive loading introduced by transmission lines.

Capacitors as Sensors
Capacitors are used as sensors to measure a variety of things including humidity, mechanical strain, and fuel levels. Two aspects of capacitor construction are used in the sensing application – the distance between the parallel plates and the material between them. The former detects mechanical changes such as acceleration and pressure, and the latter is used in sensing air humidity.

Capacitors for Signal Processing
There are advanced applications of capacitors in information technology. Capacitors are used by Dynamic Random Access Memory (DRAM) devices to represent binary information as bits. Capacitors are also used in conjunction with inductors to tune circuits to particular frequencies, an effect exploited by radio receivers, speakers, and analog equalizers.

Frequently Asked Questions on Capacitors and Capacitance
Q1
What is a variable capacitor?
A variable capacitor is a capacitor whose capacitance can be varied to a certain range of values based on necessity. The two plates of the variable capacitor are made of metals where one of the plates is fixed, and the other is movable. Their main function is to fix the resonant frequency in the LC circuit. There are two types of variable frequency and they are, tunning capacitors and trimming capacitors.
Q2
How does the shape of the capacitor affect its capacitance?
The distance between the plates
The more distant the plates are, the less the free electrons on the far plate feel the push of the electrons that are being added to the negative plate. This makes it harder to add more negative charges to the negative plate. The current will flow through a short circuit if the plates are closer. This implies that the capacitance of a parallel plate is inversely related to the plate separation.

Area of the plates
It’s easier to add charges to a capacitor if the parallel plates have a huge area. Two wide metal plates would give two repelling-like charges a greater range to spread out across the plate, making it easier to add a lot more negative charges to one plate. Likewise, a very small plate area would cause the electrons to get cramped together earlier, making it harder to get a large difference in charge for a given voltage.

Q3
What are Ultracapacitors?
An ultracapacitor, also known as the supercapacitor, is a high-capacity capacitor with a capacitance value much higher than oth
